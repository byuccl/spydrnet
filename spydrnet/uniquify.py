    Make the instances in the netlist unique
    -----------------------------------------
    Uniqification is done in place. Each instance will correspond to exactly one definition and each
    definition will correspond to exactly one instance with the exception of leaf cells. Leaf cells
    are can be instanced unlimited numbers of times. Any netlist elements that are not instantiated
    by the top instance will not be modified and may retain duplicate instances Currently there is
    no guarantee that the original definition names will be maintained, but it is guaranteed that
    they will be unique within the scope of all hardware that is below the top instance.

    Renaming is predictable. the string: _sdn_unique_# will be added to the end of the definition
    names.
