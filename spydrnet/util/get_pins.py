def get_pins(obj, *args, **kwargs):

    get_pins(obj, ...)

    Get pins *within* an object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object, Iterable - required
		The object or objects associated with this query. Queries return a collection objects
		associated with the provided object or objects that match the query criteria. For example,
		`sdn.get_ports(definition, ...)` would return all of the ports associated with the provided
		definition that match the additional criteria.
    selection : Selection.{INSIDE, OUTSIDE}, default: INSIDE
		Controls the type of pin returned. Setting this parameter to "OUTSIDE" will return the
		outer pins of the objects queried. For cables, this returns the corresponding pin based on
		this parameter.
    filter : function
		This is a single input function that can be used to filter out unwanted virtual instances.
		If not specifed, all matching virtual instances are returned. Otherwise, virtual instances
		that cause the filter function to evaluate to true are the only items returned.

    Returns
    -------
    pins : generator
       The pins associated with a particular object or collection of objects.
