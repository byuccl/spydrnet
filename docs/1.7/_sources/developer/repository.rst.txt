=================

The official SpyDrNet repository resides at https://github.com/byuccl/spydrnet/. Code in the master branch is the latest
production code. It should be tested, documented, and include examples of use. All modifications to the master branch
are received through pull requests (either forks, or branches within the project itself). For help getting started with
GitHub and git, see `GitHub Guides <https://guides.github.com/>`_.
