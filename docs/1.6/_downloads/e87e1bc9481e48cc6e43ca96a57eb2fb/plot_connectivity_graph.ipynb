        "\n# Connectivity Graph\n\n\nA connectivity graph is a mathmatical view of the connections between components in a netlist. This kind of \nrepresentation enables the use of graph theory algorithms to better understand relations between components. There are\nmany different schemes (or configurations) that could be used to generate a connectivity graph. In general, nodes in a\nconnectivity graph represent components in the netlist and edges represent connections between components.\n\nThe connectivity graph generated in this example represents leaf instances (and optionally top level ports) as nodes\nand connections between nodes as directed edges (from sources to sinks). It is assumed that input and output pins within\na leaf instance node are fully connected meaning that all input pins are connected to all output pins. This approach \nlikely suggests greater connectivity than actually exists, but it maintains plausible paths found in the original \nnetlist.\n\nA connectivity graph is generated by traversing all of paths between components in the netlist. This includes \nconnectionsthat cross hierarchical boundaries (e.g., connectivity of two leaf instances through ports on several\nnon-leaf instances). This can be an expensive operation; but once the graph is generated, it can be used to quickly \nidentify connectivity between components.\n\nA mechanism of uniquely identifying a component in the netlist is provided in this example. It is possible in a netlist\nfor a non-leaf definition, (i.e. a definition that instances other definitions), to be instanced more than once. In this\nsenarario, instances within the non-leaf definition are not unique. Uniqueness can be guarenteed by including the \nhierarchical path when referencing the desired instance. Accordingly, a lightweight object is created to preserve the\nfull hierarchical path when referencing the instances.\n\n"
