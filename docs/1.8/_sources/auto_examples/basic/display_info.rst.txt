=====================================
Display Netlist Information Functions
=====================================

Some example functions that can be run to display information in a netlist:
    1) print the hierarchy in a netlist
    2) print each library with its definitions in a netlist
    3) print connections between ports of each instance in a netlist
    4) print the number of times each primitive is instanced
    
Note: because the hierarchy function uses recursion, the maximum recursion depth may be exceeded if used for large designs

| For an even simpler display of netlist information, try using these functions with the Minimal Script example.  

| Also, JensRestemeier (not affiliated with BYU CCL) created a tool to generate images of netlists. See his `github repository <https://github.com/JensRestemeier/EdifTests>`_.
