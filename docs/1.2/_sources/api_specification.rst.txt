API Specification
=================

The SpyDrNet API can be used to create, analyze, and transform a netlist. Netlist are represented in memory in an Intermediate Representation. :numref:`fig:ExampleIR` show the representation of a simple circuit in the SpyDrNet Intermediate Representation.

   Example Netlist in the Intermediate Representaion

The API calls documented here can be used in Python as follows:

>>> # create an empty netlist and add an empty library to it
>>> import spydrnet as sdn
>>> netlist = sdn.ir.Netlist()
>>> library = netlist.create_library()
>>>

Similarly if the parser is used the calls can be made in the same way:

>>> # parse an edif file in and add an empty library to the netlist.
>>> import spydrnet as sdn
>>> netlist = sdn.parse('four_bit_counter.edf')
>>> library = netlist.create_library
>>>
