=====================================
Using Built-In Primitive Libraries
=====================================

A simple example to demonstrate using SpyDrNet's built in primitive libraries.

The b13 example netlist is targeted towards the Xilinx 7 Series family. However, because the primitives are defined in the netlist, we must first compose it out to a new netlist that does not define the primitives.

netlist_1 is parsed in without using the built in primitive library. The output shows that the port directions are undefined.

netlist_2 is parsed in using the XILINX_7SERIES primitive library. The output shows that the port directions are defined.
